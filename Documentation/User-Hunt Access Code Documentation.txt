(I was uncertain as to where this should go, so I'm making a little file that's easy to dispose of when it's no longer necessary)
Currently, a user can only be assigned to a single hunt at one time. If an admin tries
to add a user to a hunt while they were already added to another, then they get removed
from the hunt they were previously assigned to. 

After some looking, I've noticed that in ApplicationUser.cs in the models/entities folders 
(where the user is defined), the AccessCode value should be a list, in theory allowing multiple to be stored
to access multiple hunts. However, in HuntController in the task AddPlayer on line 227, when adding a user to a hunt
it essentially keeps making a new list rather than adding to it, so it keeps "deleting"
the old access code the user had. So it's not just accessing the "newest" hunt, the
user just gets removed from the old one when you add them to another hunt. 

This is what I can gather from looking at the code. It works enough in its current state, but if anyone 
decides to try and change/fix that functionality, then they should definitely take a look at what I had mentioned
before.
